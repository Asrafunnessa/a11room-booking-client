# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


#### Question: write about your project (at least 5 bullet points).


#### Answer: Here are five bullet points summarizing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication and MongoDB:

##### (1)MongoDB Integration:
-Utilize MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for storing and managing project data.
-Design data models that align with the application's requirements, taking advantage of MongoDB's flexible schema.
-Use MongoDB driver libraries (such as Mongoose for Node.js) to interact with the database in the application code.


##### (2)User Authentication with JWT:
-Implement user authentication using JWT to secure endpoints and control access to resources.
-Upon successful login, generate a JWT containing user information and a signature for verification.
-Securely store user passwords in MongoDB, preferably using hashing and salting techniques.


##### (3)Resource Creation and Reading (CR in CRUD):
-Develop endpoints to create new resources in MongoDB (e.g., inserting documents into collections).
-Implement functionality to retrieve resources from MongoDB, taking advantage of query capabilities for efficient data retrieval.
-Ensure that only authenticated users can create and access resources by validating JWTs.


##### (4)Resource Updating (Update Operation):
-Create endpoints to update existing resources in MongoDB, modifying document fields as needed.
-Implement proper authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can update resources.
-Validate and sanitize user input during the update process to prevent security vulnerabilities.


##### (5)Resource Deletion (Delete Operation):
-Implement endpoints to delete resources from MongoDB based on user requests.
-Apply proper authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can delete resources.
-Consider soft deletion (marking documents as deleted) or implement permanent deletion based on project requirements.

These points outline the key considerations for a CRUD project with JWT authentication and MongoDB integration. Such projects often involve the seamless interaction between the application, MongoDB database, and user authentication mechanisms to provide secure and efficient CRUD operations.
